# shopzters_webscraping
Scraped all the product information from shopzter.com

Shopzters.com (Website built on Shopify)

I have Scraped this website in well organized format. All the product belong to each category are scrapped into independent directory.
Each categories product images are also scrapped into independent folder   with their respective product name.
Ex: Women has subcategory saree, half saree, blouse, dress, lehnga, kurtis
etc. saree subcategory contains many products lets say p1, p2, p3, p4,â€¦ I have created directory for each products with respective product name and scraped images into it.
Tool Used: Scrapy, python, pandas.
